            Media personality Janet Mbugua is enjoying her Christmas vacation at the coast with her sister-in-law Mo Momanyi. 

The two mums tagged along with their children; Janet's two sons and Mo's daughter. 

On her social media, Janet posted photos of their family vacation. 

She praised her sister-in-law for being her cheerleader and for standing out as an influential career woman in Kenya. 

"I‚Äôll continue manifesting Rich Aunty Vibes (pic 1), made even more fun when we‚Äôre with @mo.momanyi (pic 2) and celebrating life with our little ones (pic 3).

Mini shout-out to Mo who‚Äôs not only among the Top 25 Influential Women in Digital in Kenya this year (whoop!) but she‚Äôs also the kind of person you want to holiday with in terms of keeping the energy levels up and engaging the kids full on!" Janet wrote. 

The ex-news anchor further wrote about the importance of family, no matter how complex they can be.

She added,

"Whoever family is to you, complex as relationships can often be, surround each other. Given everything life can throw at you, from left field, no less, while isolation can have its own healing, ultimately, fellowship, whether in silence or surrounded by little squeals of joy, can really comfort the soul.Whatever we have felt over the last few years, is valid.

Your experiences and processes are valid. It‚Äôs a slightly somber mood in a lot of places and we shouldn‚Äôt take good health for granted.Prayers to anyone who‚Äôs felt particularly unwell or alone. üôèüèæAnd you matter.So remember that and be kind to yourself as you look towards what we all hope will be a better year ahead." 

Notably, the two ladies were on a vacation with their children and their husbands were nowhere to be seen from the photos shared. 

This follows reports that Janet Mbugua has separated from her husband Eddie Ndichu while Mo is also apart from her hubby Paul Ndichu.
